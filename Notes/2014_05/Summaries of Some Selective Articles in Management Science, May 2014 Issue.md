* __Rewarding Volunteers: A Field Experiment__ &nbsp; by Nicola Lacetera, Mario Macis, Robert Slonim

    Should volunteers be paid? The authors conducted a field experiment with the American Red Cross (ARC) to study the effects of economic incentives on volunteer activities. They offered volunteers $5, $10, and $15 gift cards to give blood. Volunteers were more likely to donate when paid, and even more so for the higher reward values. But these offers did not affect overall willingness to volunteer over the long run.

    __Conclusion:__ Paying volunteers may create short-term bumps in willingness and awareness to contribute with no long-term effect on overall volunteerism.

* __Partnership Formation: The Role of Social Status__ &nbsp; by Haimanti Bhattacharya, Subhasish Dugar

    Would you partner with someone who is “beneath you”? The authors experimentally test for the effect of social status on the likelihood of partnership formation. They find that partnership formation is remarkably sensitive to the partners' status affiliations.

    __Conclusion:__ Collaboration is easiest when both partners share the same social status, and the probability of partnership formation decreases significantly as the status gap between the potential partners increases.
