### Dynamic Pricing of Perishable Assets Under Competition

by Guillermo Gallego, Ming Hu

Source: Management Science, May 2014

* This paper discusses dynamic price _competition_ in an oligopolistic market with a mix of substitutable and complementary perishable asset. Each competitor in the market sells fixed capacities over a finite sales horizon, such as airlines and travel sites. It is a userful source for the study of the dynamic pricing problem for parking spots.

* This paper first considers a deterministic arrival process, then study stochastic arrival processes with the insights gained from the deterministic process. In practice, a firm can resolve deterministic best-response problems with updated information about the market's conditions, such as inventory levels and demand patterns.

* The model:
    1. Consumers arrive sequentially.
    2. Make a purchase based on attributes and prices of products on the market.
    3. Arrival rate and purchase likelihood could be time dependent.

* The paper formulates the process as a finite-horizon noncooperative differential game, where demand is a deterministic fluid process

    The authors consider sub-game perfect equilibrium under the setting.
