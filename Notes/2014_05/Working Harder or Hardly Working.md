### Working Harder or Hardly Working? Posting Performance Eliminates Social Loafing and Promotes Social Laboring in Workgroups

* Studies show that group members experience a diffusion of responsibility and individuals reduce their effort and become less productive compared with working alone. This is often referred to as "social loafing" or "free riding". For a review, see

        Karau and Williams 1993

* In recent years, researchers start to document "social laboring" â€”- when working in a group can lead individuals to increase effort and be more productive compared with individuals working alone. For reviews, see

        Kerr and Hertel 2011, Larson 2010, Weber and Hertel 2007

* Motivations of individuals in a group depends on two main factors:
    * How necessary is his/her contribution to the group.
    * How does his/her performance compare to others in the group.

* This paper argues that:
    * On one hand, when posting individual performances, employees working in groups will increase motivation, i.e., social laboring.
    * On the other hand, when there is no posting of performance, employees working in groups will be inclined to reduce their task motivation, i.e., social loafing.

* My thoughts:
    * The results are quite intuitive:
        * If there is no public posting of each individual's performance, it encourages laziness as there is no negative impact for the individual, and things get done by others anyway.
        * If there is public posting, people tend to try harder either to avoid negative image of free-riding, or to outperform other group members.
    * In many situations, instead of posting performances, a more appropriate way is to have group meetings and ask group members to present their works. This is an alternative way to make the performance "salient" to other group members.
    * Another alternative might be to post the achievements and milestones accomplished of each group member on a group screen. This is an acknowledgement of people's work, and also an implicit motivation for people who are lagging behind.
