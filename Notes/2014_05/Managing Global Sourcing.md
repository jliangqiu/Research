### Managing Global Sourcing: Inventory Performance

by Nitish Jain, Karan Girotra, Serguei Netessine

Source: Management Science, May 2014

* This paper investigates the impact of global sourcing on the inventory costs through empirical import/export data and corporate financial data.

* The key findings are:
    - Firms that employ more global sourcing also have higher dollar investment in inventory.
    - In terms of inventory investment, the benefits of supplier diversification, on average, dominates the benefits of limiting sourcing to few suppliers.

* Assumptions, Background, and Goal:
    - Global sourcing is defined as a firm's demand sourced from foreign nations via sea shiptments.
    - Consider _four_ main factors in the globacl sourcing:
        + Unit procurement cost -- subject to the labor cost, scale, regularation, etc.

            Global sourcing leads to lower unit costs.
            The impact on unit procurment cost by supplier diversification depends on the cost reduction because of price competition and price increase because of less coorporation and less order volumn.

        + Lead times

            Global sourcing leads to higher lead times.

            Supplier diversification may lead to less effective lead time. See Ramasesh et al. 1991.

        + Fixed order costs -- payment for one order.

            Global sourcing has higher fixed order costs.

            Supplier diversification leads to higher fixed order costs because of less volumns ordered from each supplier.

        + Delivery reliability -- the supply chain disruption risks.

            Global sourcing is vulerable to natural and political disruptions, and is therefore subject to lower delivery reliability.

            Delivery reliability problems can be mitigated by multisourcing, or having a more dispersed supplier base. See Pan et al. 1991.

    - Conflicting impacts due to the four factors above:
        1. Unit procurement cost leads to lower average inventory cost per unit.
        2. Higher lead time, fixed order costs, and less delivery reliability lead to higher average inventory costs.
        3. More dispersed supplier base leads to lower inventory investments.
        4. Less dispersed supplier base leads to lower fixed costs.

    - **Hypothesis:**
        1. _Firms that employ more global sourcing have_ **lower** _inventory costs._
        2. _Firms with a more dispersed supplier base have_ **lower** _inventory investments._

* Data sources:
    1. A proprietory transaction level data set on all US sea imports.
    2. A publicly available country-year-level data set on business regulations compiled by the World Bank.
    3. Publicly available firm-quarter-level accounting data.

* Managerial Implications:
    1. A company increasing its global sourcing must be prepared to see more capital piled up on inventory unless it simultaneously increases the diversity of its supplier base.
    2. A firm in this data set that shifts 10% of its sourcing from domestic to global suppliers, while keeping the original mix and share of global locations, will require 8.8% higher inventory investments.
    3. From their data sets, if a firm increase the number of suppliers from one to two, there is a decrease of 11.40% in inventory investment.

* My thoughts:

    This paper discuss the impact of global sourcing and supplier diversification for large companies. This is not my area of expertise, but the conclusions are interesting. It shows that global sourcing increases the _inventory_ cost (note that this might be cancelled by having a lower manufacturing costs), and diversification of suppliers leads to lower inventory cost. A caveat: these are the data from the 3 years during the financial crisis and from public companies, so it only provides some insights, and one needs to keep the mind open to other research results.
